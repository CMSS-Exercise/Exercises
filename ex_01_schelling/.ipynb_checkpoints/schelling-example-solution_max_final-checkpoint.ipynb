    "# Mesa Schelling example - A Schelling-like Segregation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schelling (1971) segregation model is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a more happier grid space (if available). While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome can nevertheless become heavily segregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial model is a very simple simulated dynamic of agent segregation. These are the rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin as randomly placed on a grid.\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent considers how many of its surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy.\n",
    "4. If an agent is unhappy, it moves to an unoccupied cell; otherwise, an agent doesn't move\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use and modify the code\n",
    "\n",
    "These excercises are designed around a Mesa template that is given to you to reuse. You are not asked to perform any complex object programming, but instead we ask for understanding of the core features of the Mesa python package. If you want to add functionality or adapt certain features, you will mostly have to modifly the existing template and code the ``Model`` and ``Agent``behavior using standard python code.\n",

    "model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the\n",
    "global level of our model. Each instantiation of the model class will be\n",
    "a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of\n",
    "which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent\n",
    "classes are child classes of Mesa’s generic ``Model`` and ``Agent``\n",

    "- 2D position on the grid (x , y)\n",
    "- agent type [0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "(Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a position), stored in\n",
    "the ``pos`` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good\n",
